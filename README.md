- [How to Convert any Python File to .EXE](https://youtu.be/UZX5kH72Yx4)
  - pip install pyinstaller
  - pyinstaller --onefile -w main.py
    - `-W` option for app which don't need console
  - Alternative to make `really one file` use `NSIS from nullsoft scriptable install system 3.0.3`
  - Convert a .py to .exe in windows. Converting python files to executable's is fairly simple and we do this using pyinstaller. This method will work for one file or for multiple files that require dependencies such as images or other modules.
